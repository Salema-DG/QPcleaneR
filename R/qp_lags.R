#' @title Create Firm and Worker lag/lead variables
#'
#' @description
#' The goal of creating lag and lead variables is to avoid classifying them
#' after the restrictions. That is, if the goal is to know if a worker
#' separated, we should do it before the elimination of maternity,
#' for example.
#'
#' @param data A QP assembled sample as a tibble.
#'
#' @return A tibble with lag variables.
